# GifTastic
API JSON It is Giphy Time

The GifTastic project demonstrates how Giphy motion images can be accessed through an API from the Giphy Developers website. GifTastic is useful to understand how Giphy motion images from multiple topics could be added to a web page creating an impactful web site. Users can use GifTastic by selecting a button of the topic they are interested in viewing Giphy images. Users can obtain more information and assistance through the YouTube videos FSF - Unit 6 (APIs/AJAX). Stacie Knisley created and maintains this GifTastic project. 

I had difficulties completing this project because the Giphy images did not load in my web page. I sent a message to my tutor about this project and I will ask my TAs to view my project.
